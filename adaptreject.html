					<b>Fiber rich diets: </b> <br/>
                               Dietary fiber (dietary fibre, roughage) is an essential nutrient required for proper digestion of foods, proper functioning 
							   of the digestive tract at large, and for helping you feel full. A deficiency of fiber can lead to constipation, hemorrhoids, 
							   and elevated levels of cholesterol and sugar in the blood. 
                               Conversely, an excess of fiber can lead to a bowel obstruction, diarrhea, or even dehydration. 
                               Individuals who increase their intake of fiber should also increase their intake of water. 
                               High fiber foods include bran, broccoli, cabbage, berries, leafy greens, celery, squash, beans, mushrooms, and oranges. <br/><br/>
                    </p>
					
                    <p>
					<b> Calcium rich diets: </b> <br/><br/>
                       <b>Milk:</b> Milk is the best source of calcium, not only for children but also for adults. 
					   Moreover, the calcium is in a form that can be easily digested and absorbed by your body.  <br/><br/>
                       <b>Yogurt: </b>High in protein and containing healthy bacteria for your gut, yogurt is said to 
					   offer 400 mg of calcium in a single serving. Choose non-fattening flavoured yogurt for a satisfying and healthy snack. 
					   Besides milk and yogurt but dairy products like cheese is also a good dose of calcium. <br/><br/>
                       <b>Leafy greens: </b>Many vegetables, especially the leafy green veggies, are rich sources of calcium. 
					   Opt from spinach, turnip, kale, romaine lettuce, celery, broccoli, cabbage, asparagus and mushrooms 
					   or toss all of them into a salad. <br/><br/>
                       <b>Beans:</b> For another rich source of calcium, try kidney beans, white beans or baked beans. <br/><br/>
                       <b>Herbs and spices:</b> Herbs like basil, thyme, cinnamon, mint and spices like garlic not only enhance 
					   the flavour of your food but also provide calcium to your body. <br/><br/>
                       <b>Oranges: </b>Citrus fruits like oranges are not only rich in calcium but also contain vitamin D that 
					   is essential to absorb the calcium in the body. Have it as a fruit or squeeze out its juice and have it as a breakfast. <br/> <br/>
